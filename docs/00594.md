考试包括三部分：

- B节：考查考生根据信息卡就具体事实互相问答的能力。考生之间进行互动对话。信息卡上的信息涉及到日常生活、娱乐和社会活动，所用语言为英语和汉语。该节考试进行方式如下：谈论第一个话题时，考生A提问，考生B回答；谈论第二个话题时，考生B提问，考生A回答。两名考生一组，该节约需5分钟时间。
- C节：考查考生提供详细信息及阐述个人观点的能力。每位考生根据电脑提供的若干问题，进行口头陈述。该节问题内容与B节对话内容有关，考生可就其中的一个或几个问题，进行约2分钟的口头表达。

考核要求：
- 语法与词汇方面：能够适当地传输信息，语法及词汇的使用基本恰当

- 互动交际方面：能够比较积极有效地参加交际活动，谈话时可以比较顺利地做出回应，并比较成功地开始一个新的话题，能够利用互动策略就某个话题与对方进行交流

60分：能够适当地传输信息，语法及词汇的使用经常有小的不精确不恰当之处，但不影响意思表达，偶尔有些话语让对方不能理解；语音语调基本正确，话语不难理解，但有时会造成对方理解困难；能够参与一些有限的交际活动，谈话时可以做出回应，但难以开始一个新的话题，能够利用互动策略就某个话题与对方进行简单的交流，有时有些犹豫可能会令对方难以忍受。

#### How Old Is She?

　　<u>A woman was having some trouble with her heart.</u> So <u>she went to see the doctor</u>. He was a new doctor and did not know her, so he first asked some questions and one of them was, “How old are you?”<br/>
　　“Well,” she answered, “I don't remember, doctor, but <u>I will try to think.</u>” <u>She thought for a moment</u> and then said, “Yes. <u>I remember now</u>, doctor! When I married, I was eighteen years old, and my husband was thirty. <u>Now my husband is sixty, I know.</u> And that is twice thirty. So I am twice eighteen. That is thirty-six, isn't it?

#### Christmas Cards

　　It was two weeks before Christmas, and Mrs. Smith was very busy. She bought a lot of Christmas cards to <u>send to</u> her friends and to her husband’s friends, and put them on the table in the <u>living-room</u>. Then, when her husband came home from work, she said to him, “Here are the Christmas cards for our friends，and here are some stamps, a pen and <u>our book of addresses</u>. Will you please write the cards while I am cooking the dinner?”<br/>
　　Mr. Smith did not say anything, but walked out of the living-room and went to his <u>study</u>. Mrs. Smith <u>was very angry with him</u>, but did not say anything, either.
　　Then a minute later he came back with a box full of Christmas cards. All of them had addresses and stamps on them.<br/>
　　“These are from last year，” he said, “I forgot to post them. ”

Jim: <u>What a pity!</u> <u>I believe it's a very good film</u>.<br/>
Peter: Do you go to the cinema a lot?<br/>
Jim: Once a week. Most nights I sit at home and watch telly.<br/>

#### What Are the Times of Meals?

　　<u>Mr. and Mrs. Williams had always spent their summer holidays in England in the past</u>, in <u>a small boarding-house</u> at the seaside. One year, however, <u>Mr. Williams made a lot of money in his business</u>, so <u>they decided to go to Rome</u> and stay at a really good hotel while they <u>went around and saw the sights of that famous city</u>.<br/>
　　*They flew to Rome, and arrived at their hotel late one evening. They expected that they would have <u>to go to bed hungry</u> because in the boarding-houses they had been used to in the past，<u>no meals were served after seven o'clock in the evening</u>. They were therefore surprised when the clerk who received them in the hall of the hotel asked them <u>whether they would be taking dinner there</u> that night.*<br/>
　　Are you still serving dinner then?” asked Mrs. Williams.<br/>
　　Yes, certainly, madam,” answered the clerk. “ We serve it until half-past nine.“<br/>
　　"<u>What are the times of meals then</u>?” asked Mr. Williams.<br/>
　　"Well, sir,” answered the clerk，“we serve breakfast from seven to half- past eleven in the morning, lunch from twelve to three in the afternoon, <u>tea from four to five</u>, and dinner from six to half-past nine.”<br/>
　　"But <u>that hardly leaves any time for us to see the sights of Rome</u>!” said Mrs. Williams <u>in a disappointed voice</u>.

#### The Food Is Bad

Lise, Nick and Bill <u>had gone out walking for the day</u>. Nick got back at about six. “Haven’t Bill and Lise arrived yet?” he asked. “I thought <u>they were ahead of me</u>...”<br/>
It was 7:30 when Bill and Lise came in. The others were just finishing supper. “Where on earth have you been?” Nick asked.<br/>
"We’ll tell you all about it after supper, ”Bill said. “We’d better go and get our food. The warden’s already told us that we’re late...”<br/>
After supper, the group <u>sat around talking</u>.

Steve: Ugh! The food here really is bad. My soup was cold. And the meat—huh! —it was like leather!<br/>
Lise: Yes，and they don’t give you very much，either. I’m still hungry. Are hostels in England always as bad as this?<br/>
Anna: I haven’t stayed in one <u>for ages</u>. But I’m sure this one is especially bad. And the warden is so unpleasant...<br/>
Malc: “Don’t do this，don’t do that. You mustn’t do this，you can’t do that...”<br/>
Steve: Well，I’m going to write <u>a letter of complaint</u>. To the Secretary of the Youth Hostels Association!<br/>
Lise: And we’ll all help you...
