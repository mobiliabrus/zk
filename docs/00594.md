考试采用口试（机考）的形式。考试时通常两名考生为一组参加上机考试。

考试包括三部分：
- A节：考查初次见面时向人提供`个人信息`（如**名字、出生地、职业、家庭**等）的能力。由考生根据电脑提供的`问题`回答。每位考生约一分钟。
- B节：考查考生根据`信息卡`就具体事实`互相问答`的能力。考生之间进行互动对话。信息卡上的信息涉及到**日常生活、娱乐和社会活动**，**所用语言为英语和汉语**。<br/>
该节考试进行方式如下：两名考生一组。谈论第一个话题时，考生 A `提问`，考生 B `回答`；谈论第二个话题时，考生 B 提问，考生 A 回答。
- C节：考查考生提供详细信息及阐述`个人观点`的能力。每位考生根据电脑提供的若干问题，进行`口头陈述`。<br/>
该节问题内容**与 B 节对话内容有关**，考生可就其中的一个或几个问题，进行约 2 分钟的口头表达。

60分：`能够`适当地`传输信息`，语法及词汇的使用经常有小的不精确不恰当之处，但`不影响意思表达`，偶尔有些话语让对方不能理解；`语音语调基本正确`，话语不难理解，但有时会造成对方理解困难；能够参与一些有限的交际活动，谈话时可以做出回应，但难以开始一个新的话题，能够利用互动策略就某个话题与对方进行简单的交流，有时有些犹豫可能会令对方难以忍受。
