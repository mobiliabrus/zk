考试采用口试（**机考**）的形式。考试时通常两名考生为一组参加上机考试。

考试包括三部分：

- A 节：考查初次见面时向人提供个人信息（如**名字、出生地、职业、家庭**等）的能力。由考生根据**电脑提供的问题**回答。每位考生约一分钟。
- B 节：考查考生根据**信息卡**就具体事实**互相问答**的能力。考生之间进行互动对话。信息卡上的信息涉及到**日常生活、娱乐和社会活动**，所用语言为英语和汉语。该节考试进行方式如下：两名考生一组。谈论第一个话题时，考生 A **提问**，考生 B **回答**；谈论第二个话题时，考生 B **提问**，考生 A **回答**。
- C 节：考查考生提供详细信息及阐述个人**观点**的能力。每位考生根据**电脑提供的若干问题**，进行口头**陈述**。<br/>
  该节问题内容**与 B 节对话内容有关**，考生可就其中的一个或几个问题，进行约 2 分钟的口头表达。

60 分：能够**适当**地**传输信息**，语法及词汇的使用经常有小的不精确不恰当之处，但不影响意思表达，偶尔有些话语让对方不能理解；语音语调基本正确，话语不难理解，但有时会造成对方理解困难；能够参与一些有限的交际活动，谈话时可以做出回应，但难以开始一个新的话题，能够利用互动策略就某个话题与对方进行简单的交流，有时有些犹豫可能会令对方难以忍受。
