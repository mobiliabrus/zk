She bought a lot of Christmas cards to <u>send to</u> her friends and to her husband’s friends, and put them on the table in the <u>living-room</u>. Then, when her husband came home from work, she said to him, “Here are the Christmas cards for our friends，and here are some stamps, a pen and <u>our book of addresses</u>. Will you please write the cards while I am cooking the dinner?”<br/>
　　Mr. Smith did not say anything, but walked out of the living-room and went to his <u>study</u>. Mrs. Smith <u>was very angry with him</u>, but did not say anything, either.
　　Then a minute later he came back with a box full of Christmas cards. All of them had addresses and stamps on them.<br/>
