### Do you Need Extra Vitamins?

Many people believe that taking <u>vitamin supplements</u> is the best <u>safeguard</u> against the dangers of an incomplete diet, but this should be <u>a last resort</u> rather than a way out of a problem. Even if there is a genuine need for extra vitamins, then sooner or later the question arises "which one do I need, how much of them, and how often?"

* a last resort 最后一招，最后的手段
* vitamin 维他命，维生素
* supplement 增补，补充
* safeguard 保护措施
* believe - supply
* diet n.日常饮食
* diet coke 健怡可乐，无糖可乐
* rather than - instead of

The Food Standards Committee (<u>guardians</u><del> of our laws on food purity, labelling and advertising</del>) suggest in their recent report to the government that we do not need any extra vitamins.

* guardian 保护者

They say that they are "not necessary for a healthy **individual** *eating a normal diet*". <u>Whilst</u> few of us world challenge their authority on the subject of nutrition, it is, perhaps, <u>pertinent</u> to ask the question "how many of us are healthy, and what is a normal diet?"There is an element of **doubt** *in many minds about these two aspects* and **though** *few people are familiar with the wording of the Food Standards Repor*t **they** do **wonder** <u>instinctively</u> **if** *they are eating the right things*.

* individual n.个人
* whilst 尽管 = although
* pertinent 相干的；中肯的
* perhaps = maybe
* instinctively 本能地
* doubt 疑问

*although后面不加but；一般只用although，不用but*

The blame for faulty eating habits is often placed at the door of the <u>ubiquitous</u> junk and convenience foods. As we have seen, some of these are not the criminals they are made out to be. White bread is only slightly less nutritious than brown bread and frozen vegetables can be almost *as* "fresh" *as* fresh food.

* ubiquitous 普遍存在的

There are very few foods *which can really be described as pure rubbish*. Many pre-packed foods contain too much sugar and we would all benefit by avoiding these, but most tinned, processed and dried foods contain useful amounts of fat, protein, <u>carbohydrate</u>, vitamins and <u>minerals</u>. The addition of a small amount of fruit or a side salad to convenience foods such as pizzas or hamburgers can turn a snack into a well-balanced meal.

* carbohydrate 碳水化合物 *carbo碳+hydrate水合物* *carbon+dioxide二氧化碳*
* mineral 矿物质
