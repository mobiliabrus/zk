### Do you Need Extra Vitamins? 我们需要多余的维他命吗？

Many people believe that taking <u>vitamin supplements</u> is the best <u>safeguard</u> against the dangers of an incomplete diet, but this should be <u>a last resort</u> rather than a way out of a problem. Even if there is a genuine need for extra vitamins, then sooner or later the question arises "which one do I need, how much of them, and how often?"

* a last resort 最后一招，最后的手段
* vitamin 维他命，维生素
* supplement 增补，补充
* safeguard 保护措施
* believe - supply
* diet n.日常饮食
* diet coke 健怡可乐，无糖可乐
* rather than - instead of

The Food Standards Committee (<u>guardians</u><del> of our laws on food purity, labelling and advertising</del>) suggest in their recent report to the government that we do not need any extra vitamins.

* guardian 保护者

They say that they are "not necessary for a healthy **individual** *eating a normal diet*". <u>Whilst</u> few of us world challenge their authority on the subject of nutrition, it is, perhaps, <u>pertinent</u> to ask the question "how many of us are healthy, and what is a normal diet?"There is an element of **doubt** *in many minds about these two aspects* and **though** *few people are familiar with the wording of the Food Standards Repor*t **they** do **wonder** <u>instinctively</u> **if** *they are eating the right things*.

* individual n.个人
* whilst 尽管 = although
* pertinent 相干的；中肯的
* perhaps = maybe
* instinctively 本能地
* doubt 疑问

*although后面不加but；一般只用although，不用but*
