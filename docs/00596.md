### 找出主要信息和附加信息

### 阅读介绍性的短语和从句

In a reading, introductory phrases and clauses show relationship and the direction of that relationship. Further, they emphasize this relationship which helps us to understand it in terms of reading comprehension. 

For example:

I know people who do not ever attend a game; <u>on the other hand</u>, I know people who see as many as fifty games a year. Perhaps I should not make a dogmatic statement about the appeal of the sport, since I have never witnessed a game.

*We know that some people see a lot of games while some other people never go to a game.*

Girls strive for the "perfect" body and judge themselves by their looks, appearance, and <u>above all</u> thinness. 

*Weight is the problem that girls are most concerned with.*

The media plays a big part. Surrounded by thin models and TV stars, teenage girls are taught to achieve an impossible goal. <u>As a result</u>, many teenage girls intensely dislike their bodies and can tell you down to the minutest detail what's wrong with it. 

*Many teenage girls are not happy with their bodies because of the influence from media.*

These folk games were unstructured and unruly; <u>however</u>, the unity that these games brought created a need for professional sporting games. 

*What the writer said about the folk games was not negative though he said that these games were unstructured and unruly.*

The sport （baseball） <u>at first</u> excluded the public, but as economic interests infiltrated the game, the need for audiences and spectators arose.

*We understand that the game changed from a non-spectator game into a spectator one.*

<u>Despite all</u> the atrocities of racism and discrimination and the ugliness of big business and greed, baseball is still the national pastime. 

*Though there are some negative elements in the game, baseball is a popular game in America.*

Many people believe that taking <u>vitamin supplements</u> is the best <u>safeguard</u> against the dangers of an incomplete diet, but this should be <u>a last resort</u> rather than a way out of a problem.<br/>
*This statement suggests that many people have a wrong idea about vitamin supplements.*

The blame for faulty eating habits is often placed at the door of the <u>ubiquitous</u> junk and convenience foods.<br/>
*We can infer that "junk" food should be blamed for unbalanced diet.*

*阅读技巧：括号内内容不用看*<br/>
*阅读技巧：主句不是重点，从句是重点*

The Food Standards Committee (<u>guardians</u><del> of our laws on food purity, labelling and advertising</del>) suggest in their recent report to the government that we do not need any extra vitamins.

* guardian 保护者

They say that they are "not necessary for a healthy **individual** *eating a normal diet*". <u>Whilst</u> few of us world challenge their authority on the subject of nutrition, it is, perhaps, <u>pertinent</u> to ask the question "how many of us are healthy, and what is a normal diet?"There is an element of **doubt** *in many minds about these two aspects* and **though** *few people are familiar with the wording of the Food Standards Repor*t **they** do **wonder** <u>instinctively</u> **if** *they are eating the right things*.

* individual n.个人
* whilst 尽管 = although
* pertinent 相干的；中肯的
* perhaps = maybe
* instinctively 本能地
* doubt 疑问

*although后面不加but；一般只用although，不用but*

The blame for faulty eating habits is often placed at the door of the <u>ubiquitous</u> junk and convenience foods. As we have seen, some of these are not the criminals they are made out to be. White bread is only slightly less nutritious than brown bread and frozen vegetables can be almost *as* "fresh" *as* fresh food.

* ubiquitous 普遍存在的

There are very few foods *which can really be described as pure rubbish*. Many pre-packed foods contain too much sugar and we would all benefit by avoiding these, but most tinned, processed and dried foods contain useful amounts of fat, protein, <u>carbohydrate</u>, vitamins and <u>minerals</u>. The addition of a small amount of fruit or a side salad to convenience foods such as pizzas or hamburgers can turn a snack into a well-balanced meal.

* carbohydrate 碳水化合物 *carbo碳+hydrate水合物* *carbon+dioxide二氧化碳*
* mineral 矿物质

### Women and Tobacco
