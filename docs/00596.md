2. Hardly had she gone out <u>when</u> a student came to visit her. *hardly/scarcely…when/before…是固定搭配，意思是：一…就…句意：她刚出门，就有个学生来访。*
3. A completely new situation is likely to <u>arise</u> when the school leaving age is raised to 16. *句意：当离校年龄提高到16岁时，一个全新的形势就可能出现。arise 意为“出现，产生”；rise意为“上升”；raise 意为“举起，提出；饲养”；arouse 意为“引起，唤起，激起”。前两个词是不及物动词，后两个词为及物动词。*

##### text 4 so 引起的倒装句

1. Do you know Jim quarreled with his brother? I don’t know, <u>nor do I care</u>. *nor为增补意思"也不关心"，因此句子应倒装。A错在用 don’t 再次否定，C neither 用法不对且缺乏连词。D缺乏连词。另外，当so引出的句子用以对上文内容加以证实或肯定时，不可用倒装结构。意为"的确如此"。*
2. John had been working hard and <u>so had his brother</u>. *在肯定句中，so位于句首并采用倒装语序，表示前后的动作相同，so相当于also（也）。前后时态必须一致，均用过去完成进行时。句意为：约翰一直工作很努力，他兄弟也是如此。*

##### text 6 短文概括大意

2. Everybody wastes time. Instead of doing their homework, school boys watch television. Writers neglect their work, and wander in the room making cups of coffee and daydreaming.

The vicious <u>circle</u> of wasting time. *vicious circle指的是“恶性循环”的意思。*

1. Most people don’t limit their purchases to what they can afford with the cash they have on hand. Nearly every household owes some money or debts, perhaps in the form of a car loan, a house mortgage or charges on credit cards. On these loans, people pay an interest fate, usually so much per year based on the amount loaned. Interest, too, is a price, the price paid for the use of money, and it has to be enough to make it worthwhile for the lender to forgo use of the funds. Give up; quit--<u>forgo</u> * forgo表示“停止，放弃”的意思。*
2. Where money goes? About 70 percent of the average household’s spending goes for necessities such as housing, food, clothes and health care. To be able to afford these items and still have money left for nonessentials such as travel and entertainment, most families find themselves economizing and watching their pennies. The same problem of matching limited resources with seemingly endless demands confronts businesses and public agencies. Face boldly or threateningly--<u>confront</u> *confront：面对，使面临。*
3. If many businesses are offering a product and there is plenty of it to satisfy the needs of all consumers, a producer will be forced to sell at a price not far above costs in order to keep from being stuck with a lot of unmarketable supplies.

1. Thus, at the same time that the industrial revolution made it possible to produce goods more cheaply and more quickly in factories, agricultural revolution also took place. Instead of leaving fields empty every third year, farmers began to plant clover or some other crop that would enrich the soil. Instead of using only animal fertilizer, farmers began to use chemical fertilizers to keep the soil rich. These methods have enabled French farmers, for example, to get five times as much wheat as was obtained from the same land two centuries ago. Material for enriching land--<u>fertilizer</u> *Material for enriching land“使土地肥沃的物质”*
2. About three hundred years ago, there were approximately half a billion people in the world. In the two centuries that followed the population doubled, and, by 1850, there were more than a billion people in the world. It took only 75 years for the figure to double once more, so that now the population figure stands at approximately three and one half billion. Each day the population of the world increases by about 150,000. Symbol for a number--<u>figure</u> *the figure to double在本句中figure表示的是“数字”的意思。*
3. At the same time, constant progress has been going on in industry. Fifty years ago it took a day to assemble the pieces of an automobile. Today one factory can produce one car in a minute.

Modern industry needs large numbers of specialized workers. The less specialized workers are gradually being replaced by new machines. Keep watch over work and workers as the person in charge--<u>supervise</u> *supervise：监督，管理，引导。*

1. Since their first appearance on earth, men have gathered information and have attempted to pass useful ideas to others. The carvings of word-pictures on the walls of ancient caves as well as symbols on stone tablets represent some of man’s earliest efforts to convey information. Scenes of hunting, maps of battles, and stories of heroes were put down for all to see. Make ideas, views and feelings known to another person--<u>convey</u>
2. But as civilizations grew more complex, better methods of communication were needed. The written word, the carrier pigeon, the telegraph, and many other devices carried ideas faster and faster from person to person. In recent years one type of machine, the electronic computer, has become increasingly important in the lives of all people in the industrialized nations of the world. Computers are now widely used aids for communication, calculation, and other activities. Their effect becomes more important every day. The act or action of passing on or exchanging--<u>communication</u>

1. This is not surprising since a hallmark of the Cyber Age is connectivity and sharing of information. The assertion that “information is meant to be free” is an increasing reality since it can be moved from those who have it to those who need it in the blink of an eye- and at virtually no cost, unlike for other media. This computer driven contribution to the vitality of the U. S. economy is immeasurable. The strength and ability of an organization, country etc to continue-- <u>vitality</u> *本句所指的是“美国经济的繁荣”，即vitality：活力，生命力。*
2. Today, there’s scarcely an aspect of our life that isn’t being upended by the torrent of information available on the hundreds of millions of sites crowding the Internet, not to mention its ability to keep us in constant touch with each other via electronic mail. “If the automobile and aerospace technology had exploded at the same pace as computer and information technology,” says Microsoft, “a new car would cost about $2 and go 600 miles on a thimbleful of gas. And you could buy a Boeing 747 for the cost of a pizza. ” A very small quantity of liquid--<u>thimbleful</u> *thimbleful表示“极少量（指酒等液体）”。*
3. One of the Internet’s truly great features is that anybody can be a player who has an idea for a Web site and a few dollars to get it up and running. Possibly the most notorious site of all is the one dreamed up by an 18-year-old dropout from Northeastern University in Boston, Shawn Fanning, nicknamed the "Napster" for his unruly red hair. Famous or well-known for something bad--<u>notorious</u> *notorious表示的是“臭名昭著的”意思。*

1. Now it is the census taker that does the traveling in the fond hope that a highly mobile population will stay long enough to get a good sampling. Methods of gathering, recording, and evaluating information have presumably been improved a great deal. And where then it was the modest purpose of Rome to obtain a simple head count as an adequate basis for levying taxes, now batteries of complicated statistical series furnished by governmental agencies and private organizations are eagerly scanned and interpreted by sages and seers to get a clue to future events. Taxation in Roman days apparently was based on <u>population</u>. *“那时罗马计算人头作为征税的适当基础，目的很简单。”A. 财富。 B. 流动性。 D. 人口调查员。*
2. In England the Reformers, or Protestants, aided by the power of the Crown, had at this stage triumphed, but over Europe as a whole Rome was beginning to recover some of the ground it had lost after Martin Luther’s revolt in the earlier part of the century. It did this in two ways, by the activities of its missionaries, as in parts of Germany, or by the military might of the Catholic Powers, as in the Low Countries, where the Dutch provinces were sometimes near their last extremity under the pressure of Spanish arms. Through what way did the Rome recover some of the lost land? <u>Religious and military ways. </u> *这一段第二句说明：“教皇用两种办法进行恢复，一种就像在部分德国地区进行的那样通过传教士的活动，另一种像在低地国里进行的，通过天主教国家的军事力量。那里荷兰的几个省份在西班牙的军事压力下，常常是被逼迫得几乎走投无路了。”A. civil and military ways文武两手，civil范围太广，特别指民事的，非宗教的，文职的。这里不合适。B. 宣传和抨击。C. 劝说和批评。都不对。*
3. By 1950, the results of attempts to relate brain processes to mental experience appeared rather discouraging. Such variations in size, shape, chemistry, conduction speed, excitation threshold, and the like as had been demonstrated in nerve cells remained negligible in significance for any possible correlation with the manifold dimensions of mental experience. Up until 1950, efforts to establish that brain processes and mental experience are related would most likely have been met with <u>discouragement</u>. *答案见文章的第一句话“到了1950年，大脑活动过程和精神感受有关系的实验结果看起来令人沮丧。”*

1. He backs up his pitch with facts. Numerous studies, including recent reports by the Center for the Study of Reading and the National Council of Teachers of English, confirm that reading to children builds vocabulary, stimulates imagination, stretches the attention pan, nourishes emotional development, and introduces the textures and nuances of the English language. Reading aloud is, in essence, an advertisement for learning to read. To support, make certain, give proof of--<u>confirm</u> *confirm表示“确认，证实”的意思。*
2. His audience is surprised to hear that only 22 percent of eighth-graders read for fun daily, while 65 percent watch three hours or more of television each day.

Being thoroughly skilled, well practiced--<u>proficiency</u> *proficiency指的是“熟练，精通”的意思。*

1. No one can claim that the fashion industry contributes anything really important to society. Fashion designers are rarely concerned with vital things like warmth, comfort and durability. They are only interested in outward appearance and they take advantage of the fact that women will put up with any amount of discomfort, providing they look right. There can hardly be a man who hasn’t at some time in his life smiled at the sight of a woman shivering in a flimsy dress on a wintry day, or delicately picking her way through deep snow in dainty shoes. What are fashion designers interested in? <u>Outward appearance</u> *外观。答案在“没有人认为时装工业为社会作过真正的贡献。时装设计师很少关心保暖，舒服和耐穿这类紧要的事，他们只是对外观感兴趣，他们利用了妇女的心理：只要看着美，她们能忍受一切（痛苦）不舒服……。”B. 舒适。C. 美，时装不一定美。D. 耐穿。*
2. Another similarity between legitimate business and its illegal counterpart is price fluctuation. Just as the prices of products traded legally vary with quality and market conditions such as supply and demand, so do the prices of goods go up and down in the smuggling trade. Consider the price of drugs. Heroin and cannabis, in whatever form or by whatever name, cone in several grades, each with a going price. The wholesale price at which big dealers sell to big dealers is less than the street price. When the authorities are successful in reducing the supply buy seizures, the price of all grades rises. When is the price going down? <u>The quality of the foods and market condition are not very well. </u> *货物质量和市场情况不好。第二句“正如合法商业按质论价和按市场供需价一样，走私商品也是按这两者调节价格的上升和下降。”所以当质量和市场情况不好价格就跌。B. 货物质量和市场变化。这并不一定跌价，也可能上升。C. 供需不平衡。并没有说明供大于求，和跌价无关。D. 其它商品价波动。这不一定下跌。所以B，C，D都不对。*
3. You hear the refrain all the time: the U.S. economy looks good statistically, but it doesn’t feel good. Why doesn’t ever-greater wealth promote ever-greater happiness? It is a question that dates at least to the appearance in 1958 of The Affluent (富裕的) Society by John Kenneth Galbraith, who died recently at 97. What question does John Kenneth Galbraith raise in his book The Affluent Society? <u>Why affluence doesn’t guarantee happiness. </u> *我们根据题干中的定位词The Affluent Society很快定位到原文的第一段的本句“It is a question that dates at least to the appearance in 1958 of The Affluent (富裕的) Society by John Kenneth Galbraith”。本句中所出现的“question”正是题干中的“question”，因为本句中question是一个指代，必须追到该句的上一句，并且去寻找question所指代的内容，这才是我们需要找的答案，通过定位与寻找，不难发现B选项就是我们所找的答案。*

1. Trends in age-specific violent arrest rates for homicide, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault confirm the patterns found in homicide statistics. Teenagers now exceed all age groups, even young adults, in their absolute rate of arrest for violent crime overall. Conventional wisdom in criminology –that young adults generally represent the most violence-prone group –apparently needs to be modified in light of these disturbing changes. Sudden violent attack--<u>assault</u> *assault表示“突袭，攻击”的意思。*
2. Guns are far more lethal in several respects. A 14-year-old armed with a gun is far more menacing than a 44-year-old with a gun. Although juveniles may be untrained in using firearms, they are more willing to pull the trigger over trivial matters —a leather jacket, a pair of sneakers, a challenging remark, or no reason at all — without fully considering the consequences. Also, the gun psychologically distances the offender from the victim; if the same youngster had to kill his or her victim (almost always someone known) with hands, he or she might be deterred by the physical contact. Of little significance or value--<u>trivial</u> *trivial：琐碎的，不重要的。*
3. The problem of kids with guns cannot be overstated in view of recent trends in gun-related killings among youth. Since the mid-1980s, the number of gun-homicides —particularly with handguns —perpetrated by juveniles has quadrupled, while the prevalence of juvenile homicide involving all other weapons combined has remained virtually constant. To state in exaggerated terms--<u>overstated</u> *overstated表示的意思是“夸张”。*

<br/>在发展中国家，吸烟也日益成为女性健康不佳的重要原因。

Women's health is also affected by the smoking of others, that is, by passive or involuntary smoking; for example, it has been shown that nonsmoking wives of heavy smokers run a higher risk of lung cancer.
<br/>妇女的健康也受到其它吸烟者的影响，就是说被动吸烟或不情愿吸烟；例如，不吸烟的妻子们很显然在冒着患肺癌很高的危险，因为和她们吸烟成性的丈夫们生活在一起。

The challenge is twofold: to reduce the already high level of smoking among women in the industrialized world and to ensure that the low level of smoking in developing countries does not increase.
<br/>回答这一问题具有双重含义，其一是降低发达国家妇女吸烟人数的高比率；其二也要保证发展中国家妇女吸烟人数的比率不要上升。
