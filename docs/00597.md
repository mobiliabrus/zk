But actually the umbrella was not invented as protection against rain. It was first used as a shade against the sun. Nobody knows who first invented it, but the umbrella was used in very ancient times. Probably the first to use it were the Chinese, way back in the eleventh century We know that the umbrella was also used in ancient Egypt and Babylon as a sunshade. And there was a strange thing connected with its use; it became a symbol of honor and authority. In the Far East In ancient times, the umbrella was allowed to be used only by royal people or by those in high office. Umbrella was made of wooden materials. In Europe, the Greeks were the first to use the umbrella as a sunshade. And the umbrella was in common use in ancient Greece. But it is believed that the first persons in Europe to use the umbrellas as protection against the rain were the ancient Romans. During the Middle Ages, the use of the umbrella practically disappeared. Then it appeared again in Italy in 16th century. And again it became a symbol of power and authority. Umbrellas have not changed much in style during all this time, though they have become much lighter in weight. It wasn’t until the twentieth century that women’s umbrellas began to be made in a variety of colors. <u>Umbrella was made of wooden materials.</u>','Read the following paragraph carefully and select the best topic sentence from the four possible answers that follow the paragraph.\nCompetition is seen as an open and fair race where success goes to the swiftest person regardless of his or her social class background.

He went from a world where illiterate people footed their way on dirt roads, where one-room schools had peat fires in the corner, where stories were told at night in shadows and candlelight, to a world of motor cars and electricity and telephones and radio and X-ray machines and television. He never left Ireland, although late in life he wanted to go to England in an airplane to experience flying.

When we eat, we consume energy. When we exercise, we expend energy— or burn up calories. For example, when we run for an hour, we burn up approximately 450 calories, depending on our body size. When the number of calories we consume exceeds the number we burn up, the excess energy is stored in the body in the form of fat. If a person is inactive, it is more likely that he will not burn up all the calories consumed, so obesity can result. Moreover, studies have shown that inactivity can cause an obese person to expend less energy during a certain activity than a no obese person. This is because inactivity lowers the basal energy rate. Therefore, if an obese person and a no obese person try to run one mile, the obese person unused to activity will expend less energy because he has a lower basal energy rate. <u>A lack of exercise is one of the major factors contributing to obesity.</u>','Read the following paragraph and choose the irrelevant sentences from the four possible answers that follow the paragraph.\nIn order to learn a foreign language well, it is necessary to overcome the fear of making mistakes. If the primary goal of language use is communication, then mistakes are secondary considerations that may be dealt with gradually as awareness of those mistakes increases. On the other hand, students should not ignore their mistakes. The language learner may observe how native speakers express themselves, and how native expressions differ from the way the learner might say them. In this condition, we should pay more attention to mistakes. For example, a Spanish speaker who has been saying “I do it” to express willingness to do something in the immediate future, could, by communicating with native speakers of English, observes that native speakers actually say “I’ll do it”. This difference can serve as a basis for the student to change his way of using the present tense in English. But a student who is unwilling to communicate in the first place would lose this opportunity to learn by trial and error. <u>In this condition, we should pay more attention to mistakes.</u>','Read the following paragraph and choose the irrelevant sentences from the four possible answers that follow the paragraph.\nRecent research has begun to document the ways dreams can help people deal with problems in their waking lives. Rosalind Cartwright (1978) has found that people seem to handle emotional situations more realistically after dreaming. In one study, she presented students with incomplete ‘problem stories’ before bedtime in a sleep laboratory. The stories dealt with common concerns of young adults, such as separation from home. The subjects then went to sleep. Some were allowed to dream (they were awakened only during non-REM sleep), while others were not (they were awakened only during REM sleep or were not allowed to sleep at all). In the morning, when asked about possible solutions to the problem posed in a story, the subjects who had been allowed to dream were better to acknowledge the realistic dimensions of the problem. Dream can broaden our thinking in a sense. The results of this and other studies have led Cartwright to propose that dreams provide a kind of workshop for the repair of self-esteem and competence. <u>Dream can broaden our thinking in a sense.</u>','Read the following paragraph and choose the irrelevant sentences from the four possible answers that follow the paragraph.\nUnder normal conditions the act of communication requires the presence of at least two persons: one who sends and one who receives the communication. In order to communicate thoughts and feelings, there must be a conventional system of signs or symbols which mean the same to the sender and the receiver. The means of sending communications are too numerous and varied for systematic classification: therefore, the analysis must begin with the means of receiving communications. Reception of communication is achieved by our senses. Sight, hearing and touch play the most important roles. Smell and taste play very limited roles. Communications were developed by our ancestor far long time ago. Examples of visual communication are gesture and imitation. Although both frequently accompany speech, there are systems that rely solely on sight, such as those used by deaf and dumb persons. Another means of communicating visually is by signals of fire, smoke, flags or flashing lights. Feelings may be simply communicated by touch such as by handshaking, although a highly-developed system of handshaking as disabled blind, deaf, and dumb persons to communicate intelligently. Whistling to someone, clapping hands in a theater, and other forms of communication by sound rely upon the ear as a receiver. The most fully-developed form of auditory communication is, of course, the spoken language. The means of communication mentioned so far have two features in common: they last only a short time, and the persons involved must be relatively close to each other. Therefore, all are restricted in time and space. <u>Communications were developed by our ancestor far long time ago.</u>','Read the following paragraph and choose the irrelevant sentences from the four possible answers that follow the paragraph.\n“Thank you” is used much more frequently in the West than in China. When anyone does something for you, no matter how small and no matter whether she/he is a superior or a servant, it is proper to say “ thank you”. It is important for a person to hold good manners anywhere or anytime both in China and the west. For example, you would say “thank you” in any of the following circumstances: if someone picked up and handed to you something you had dropped; if your neighbor at table or a servant passed some food to you; if someone showed you the way to go; if a member of the family, even if quite young, brought you something you wanted; if your postman handed you a letter; if a clerk in a store handed you the article you had bought. When anything is offered to you, it is not polite to say, “I don’t want it”, as Chinese manner would allow. You should say, “Yes, thank you,” if you wish it; or “No, thank you,” if you refuse it. <u>It is important for a person to hold good manners anywhere or anytime both in China and the west.</u>','Read the following paragraph carefully and select the best topic sentence from the four possible answers that follow the paragraph.\nIn ancient time, dancing was used to share information. For instance, if the head man of a primitive tribe wanted his men to hunt for food, he would first dance around acting like an animal and then he would change his dancing to pretend to shoot an animal. He would try to have his men follow his example. When he was sure that his followers understood his intention, he would lead his excited hunters to chase and kill the animals they needed for food. In modern times, dancing is mainly for physical exercises. Most people do not care much about whether they are dancing gracefully or not. Of more importance is that they move their bodies for half an hour or so. For these people, dancing is another way of getting their daily exercises. <u>Dancing serves people in many different ways.</u>','Read the following paragraph carefully and select the best topic sentence from the four possible answers that follow the paragraph.\nMy chief reason for choosing Bingston University was its wonderful work/study program in agriculture, my chosen field. The university requires all its agriculture students to gain practical experience by working on farms in the area while they are still going to school; I know that this would provide invaluable experience and prepare me to use the skills I had learned in the classroom. Second, Bingston hires only the finest teachers. Then, too, there was Bingston’s deferred payment plan; this represented a great convenience to my parents. A final reason was the reasonable tuition. <u>There are several reasons why I decided to attend Bingston University.</u>','Read the following paragraph carefully and select the best topic sentence from the four possible answers that follow the paragraph. \nThey always complained more or less justly, that their parents are out of touch with modern ways.
