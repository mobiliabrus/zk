But actually the umbrella was not invented as protection against rain. It was first used as a shade against the sun. Nobody knows who first invented it, but the umbrella was used in very ancient times. Probably the first to use it were the Chinese, way back in the eleventh century We know that the umbrella was also used in ancient Egypt and Babylon as a sunshade. And there was a strange thing connected with its use; it became a symbol of honor and authority. In the Far East In ancient times, the umbrella was allowed to be used only by royal people or by those in high office. Umbrella was made of wooden materials. In Europe, the Greeks were the first to use the umbrella as a sunshade. And the umbrella was in common use in ancient Greece. But it is believed that the first persons in Europe to use the umbrellas as protection against the rain were the ancient Romans. During the Middle Ages, the use of the umbrella practically disappeared. Then it appeared again in Italy in 16th century. And again it became a symbol of power and authority. Umbrellas have not changed much in style during all this time, though they have become much lighter in weight. It wasn’t until the twentieth century that women’s umbrellas began to be made in a variety of colors. <u>Umbrella was made of wooden materials.</u>','Read the following paragraph carefully and select the best topic sentence from the four possible answers that follow the paragraph.\nCompetition is seen as an open and fair race where success goes to the swiftest person regardless of his or her social class background.

Some evenings also hatted-he would play the fiddle. He was born in Ireland in 1874, and he lived to see, in his long life, satellites, computers, jet airplanes and, the Apollo space program. He went from a world where illiterate people footed their way on dirt roads, where one-room schools had peat fires in the corner, where stories were told at night in shadows and candlelight, to a world of motor cars and electricity and telephones and radio and X-ray machines and television.
