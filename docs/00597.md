It is widely considered that finance and accounting majors are most competitive in the job market. **In fact, liberal arts graduates are much more valued for their soft skills.** A recent survey found that 30 percent of companies were recruiting liberal arts graduates, far ahead of finance and accounting at 18 percent. Companies are looking for soft skills over hard skills now, because hard skills can be learned, while soft sills need to be developed. And the letter seems to be in short supply. According to other studies, “only a quarter of college graduates have the writing and thinking skills necessary to do their jobs." Graduates are said to have trouble "communicating, working in teams, and seeing complex problems from different angles"—— exactly the vision of a liberal arts education.

Art can be almost anything. It has changed almost every day since the first artist created the first work at least fifty thousand years ago. The most significant changes have been brought about by the genius of a single artist. Some changes have come about through the invention of new media and new techniques- say, the both of manuscript illumination, oil paint, or perspective. Other changes have come about because a young artist threw aside all traditions and depicted his or her world in a fresh, different, and completely new way. Each change was initially looked upon with suspicion as to its artistic worth, but in time, each was accepted. And the same will be true of all the weird subjects, styles, and media that will show up in the future.
- The one constant thing about art is that it is forever changing.
- <del>Young artists tend to make breakthroughs in drawing techniques.</del>
- <del>Changes in art will be either accepted or rejected as time goes by.</del>
- <del>Things considered non-arts one day can be popular arts another day.</del>

You're not the only one who could eat up a bag of chips in one sitting. **The reason you keep dipping your fingers back into the chip bag has more to do with salt than with fat.** Normally, fat helps make a meal more satisfying as it provides high calories, so people don't want to just keep eating and eating. However, eating salt triggers the release of dopamine, a chemical substance that controls your brain's pleasure center. Once your brain gets that first reward hit, it starts wanting more. When food is low in salt, it's easy to practice self-control instead of overeating, but when you add salt to that food, all of a sudden, those controls are gone.
