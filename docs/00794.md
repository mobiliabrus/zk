现在进行时
- 表示动作正在进行或发生
- 常用语进行时的标志性的词。Now,these days,always.Forever

### 将来时的表达方式

**用 shall 和 will 表将来时**

**用一般现在时的形式表示将来**
- 表示已经预先计划、安排好的或肯定将要发生的动作。主要用于come， go, start, leave, arrive, return, begin等动词，尤指交通工具的行程。The plane leaves at 8 tonight.
- 在时间、条件、方式、让步状语从句中，表示将来的动作。

If I drop the bottle, it will break.<br/>

**用现在进行时表将来时**
- 表示近期确定的安排，但必须指出这种安排的具体时间，以免与现在正 在进行所表示的时间概念混淆。I’m taking an exam in October.
- go, come, arrive, fly, start, leave, travel (表示来、去) Are you comingt hise vening?

- be + about to 表示立刻就要发生的事。The film is about to start.

### 现在完成时

- 构成：主语 + have / has + 过去分词 + 其他
- 否定式：主语 + haven’t / hasn’t + 过去分词 + 其他
- 疑问式：Have / Has + 主语 + 过去分词 + 其他?
- 简略答语：
  - Yes, 主语 + have / has.(肯定)
  - No, 主语 + haven’t / hasn’t.(否定)

#### 现在完成时的标志词

现在完成时的含义之一是过去完成的动作对现在仍有影响
- 以already, just和yet为标志：already, just和yet表示到现在为动作或状态已经、刚刚或还没有发生。
  - He has already got her help
  - He has just seen the film.
  - He hasn’t come back yet.
- 以ever和never为标志：ever和never表示到现在为止动作或状态曾经或从来没有发生过。

  - He has got to Beijing so far.
  - She has passed the exam so far.

#### “终止”、“延续”要转换

英语中的动词从词义上可以分为延续性和非延续性两种。在现在完成时态中一定要注意动词这一特性，应将这类非延续性动词转换为延续性动词。
- “Cats” has been on for half an hour.
- How long have you had this dictionary?

#### 时间“点”、“段”须分清

过去开始的动作可以延续到某一点结束，也可能继续延续，这时就要根据时间“点”、“段”选择相应的介词for或since。

- He has been away for two years.
- He has been an English teacher since 1992.

### 现在完成进行时

现在完成进行时表示某动作从过去某个时间开始，一直延续到现在，并且还有可能持续下去。

- The dollar has been climbing steadily all week.

现在完成进行时所用的时间状语：all day / month; this month / week / year; these days; recently / lately; in the past few + 时间段; since +时间点; for + 时间段，等等。
- He has been working all day.
- They have been building the bridge for two month.
- They have been planting trees this month.
- Car sales have been shrinking recently.
- Vera has been trying to learn Chinese for years.

现在完成进行时与现在完成时的区别
- 现在完成时强调动作的完成，而现在完成进行时强调动作的延续，因此，表示动作的完成，只能用现在完成时，而不能用现在完成进行时。
  - He has changed his idea.
- 在表示动作的延续时，虽然既可用现在完成时，也可用现在完成进行时，但现在完成进行时强调动作的进行。因此在需要明确表示动作还要持续下去时，应用现在完成进行时。
  - We have been studying here for two years.
- 现在完成进行时表示一种不间断的动作，因此在提到做一件事的次数或所做事情的种类时，不能用该时态，而只能用现在完成时。
  - I have knocked the door five times, but I’m afraid nobody is in.

### 过去完成时

过去完成时(past perfect tense)：强调的是过去某一动作或状态发生在另一动作前或过去某个时间，或指在过去某个时间段已经发生的事情，它就是过去的过去。

- They had wanted to help but could not get there in time.
- We had hoped to be able to come and see you.

### 被动语态

#### 一般现在/过去时

- The foreign guests were given a warm welcome by the children.
- This speech was delivered by comrade Wang. （”was delivered”即一般过去时的被动态）

#### 完成时态

“have done”，被动将“been”加中间。

#### 一般将来

“shall(will) do”，被动变“do”为“be done”

#### 现在进行/过去进行

现在进行时：“be doing”
过去进行时：be（过去） + being + done

#### 先行词的选择

|句子成分|用于限制从句或非限制性从句|只用于限制性从句||
|:----------:|:----------:|:---------:|:---------:|

Is it possible that these next-door neighbors have never spoken to one another.

#### 表语从句

在复合句中，位于系动词之后作表语的从句叫表语从句。引导表语从句的关联词与引导主语从句的关联词大致一样，表语从句位于连系动词后，有时用as if引导。

同位语从句和定语从句的区别：
- that作为关系代词，可以引导定语从句，充当句子成分，在从句中作宾语时可以省略；
- that引导同位语从句时，起连词的作用，没有实际意义，不充当句子成分，一般不能省略。

I had no idea that you were here.（that引导同位语从句，不能省略）
