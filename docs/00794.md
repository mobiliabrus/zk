## 从句

做题技巧：**找从句、查成分、补意思**

`Whoever` **wins the election** is going to have tough job getting the economy back on its feet.

### 定语从句

定语从句（Attributive Clauses）在句中做定语，修饰一个名词或代词，被修饰的名词，词组或代词即先行词。定语从句通常出现在先行词之后，由关系词（关系代词或关系副词）引出。

#### 先行词的选择

|  | 限制从句、非限制性从句 | 仅限制性从句  |            |
| :------: | :------------------------: | :---------------: | :--------: |
|          |           代替人           |      代替物       | 代替人或物 |
|   主语   |            who             |       which       |            |
|   主语   |            whom            |       which       |    that    |
|   宾语   |      whose (=of whom)      | whose (=of which) |    that    |

定语从句中，whom 只能用在从句中充当宾语成分，而 who 都可以：
- The man **who** is first in the match race is called Jimmy.
- The man **who** you met in the bus is my friend.
- The man **whom** you met in the bus is my friend.
- Modernism is a trend **whose** influence has been strong in the arts.

of whom/which：
- He’s written a book, **the name of which** I’ve forgotten.
- He’s written a book, **whose name** I’ve forgotten.
- Our school has 80 teachers, 50 **of whom** are women.

在非限制性定语从句中，先行词作为一个整体，表示整体中的一部分，即表示“部分与整体”的关系时，不能用 whose 来代替 of which。
- I picked up the apples, some **of which** were badly bruised.

#### 介词 ＋ 关系代词

“介词＋关系代词“结构中的介词可以是 in, on, about, from, for, with, to at, of, without 等，关系代词只可用 whom 或 which，不可用 that。
- I had dream **in which** I became the King.
- The man **with whom** you talked is my neighbour.

from where 为“介词＋关系副词“结构，但也可以引导定语从句。
- We stood at the top of the hill, **from where** we can see the town.

像 listen to, look at, depend on, pay attention to, take care of 等固定短语动词，在定语从句中一般**不宜将介词与动词分开**。
- This is the boy **whom** she has **taken care of**.

#### 关系词只能用 that 的情况

先行词被**序数词**或形容词**最高级**所修饰，或本身是序数词、基数词、形容词最高级时，只能用 that，而不用 which。
- He was **the first** person **that** passed the exam.
- This is **the best** book **that** I have read.

- **All** **that** can be done has been done.

- This is **the same** bike **that** I lost.
- She is **the very** girl **that** has got a prize.

先行词里同时含有人或物时，只能用 that， 而不用 which。

### How Dictionaries Are Made

词典是怎样编写出来的？是先由学者、专家们给每个词写出定义，然后搜集例句加以说明吗？词典是人人应当尊重的权威吗？什么样的词典是好词典？
- From two or three to several **hundreds sentences** are usually **collected** to **illustrate** **a word**. 
- People generally think that dictionaries and grammar books are the highest authority in the matter of meaning and usage. In the **United States**, if a person **doesn’t agree** with the **dictionary**, he is regarded as **out of his mind**.
- The first step in making a dictionary **begins** with **reading** **huge amounts** of the **literature** of the period of subject that the dictionary is to cover. 
- As the editor read, they copy on cards every unusual use of a common word, a large number of common words in their ordinary uses, and also the sentences in which each of these words appears. 
- As the cards are collected, they are **arranged** in **alphabetical order**. 
- When the editors write definitions, they must according to the cards. The definitions of a word must be based on what the sentences show about its meanings. He shouldn’t be influence by his own ideas about the meanings of a word. 
- The author says writing a dictionary is recording the meaning of words as writes use them. The dictionary writer is not a lawgiver, but simple a historian. That is to say, he doesn’t make rules for words; he records how words have been used. 
- Because as society develops, new words keep comingint the language, and old words often acquire new meanings.No one can look into the future and know what new meanings an old word would have.Nor does the dictionary writer.Those is the reasons why it is wrong to regard the dictionary as an"authority". 
- Because new situations, new experiences, new inventions, new feelings are always making us give new uses to old words.Those is the reasons why we should not be bound by the dictionary in choosing our words. 
- We can learn from the text , I think, we should pay attention two things in learning English:First, we must remember that a word may have several meanings, and the same word may mean different things in different sentences.So the best way to learn words is to understand them in context.Second, all languages change as times change.So we should keep our mind open and ready to learn new words, new things and new ideas.

### Little Things Are Big

天午夜之后，一个来自南美的黑人移民在纽约乘地铁时见到一位拖儿带女，手携提包的白人妇女，且不约而同地在同一站下车。站台别无他人，他本想伸出友情之手，但在种族分歧如此之深的国家，又怕引起她的误解。他干脆对她的困难视而不见。然而这件“小事”使他内心久久不能平静……
- On the eve of one Memorial Day the author was on the **subway** train at the 34th Street Pennsylvania Station. 
- The young woman tried hard to push herself in with a baby on her right arm, a traveling bag in her left and two children following after he. 
- When the writer saw the woman getting ready to get off the next station, he was also preparing to get off at the Atlantic Avenue. 
- The writer wanted to help the woman,because it was very late at night. 

The woman needed someone to help her to get out of the station, the writer saw her problem, he wanted to help her,but didn't help her,because he know that there were racism and prejudice. 

If a black man approached a white lady in a subway station late at night,the white lady might scream because she thought the black would rob her of her bag. 

The writer was ashamed of not helping the woman, because people thought it was a common thing.He thought if the white lady was not prejudiced, he would have failed her,her children,even himself. He wrote the article in order to let the lady know that he was very sorry. 

The writer made his mind if he would face with the same situation again, he would offer his help regardless of whether the offer was going to be received. 

The title"little things are big",explaining following:people will regard what happened in the text as a thing,but for the writer,he thought it was a big thing,people should be courteous to each other, not prejudiced,no matter whoever you are ,black or white. 

When Jesus Colon walked past the young lady,the felt like a rude animal walking on two legs. 

This is what racism and prejudice and chauvinism and a divided society can do to the people and to a nation. 

So many slanders are written every day in the daily press against Negroes and Puerto Ricans. 

### The Story of an Hour

一位已婚女士闻其丈夫惨死于火车事故，不顾自己衰弱的心脏能否经受得住，当即入放声痛哭，随后又不顾亲友的劝告将自己锁在屋内。她推开窗子，迎来外面雨后的一片春意盎然。那充满生机的景象突然唤醒了长期隐藏在她心底深处的愿望，她感到了身心从未有过的自由。正当她憧憬着未来的自由时……

1-Richards bring to Louise there was a train accident, his husband, Brently, was dead. 
Louise's sister, Josephine broke this news to her in broken sentences, because Louise Mallard had a weak heart. 
2-Louise did not hear the story calmly, like some women would. She could not close her mind or her heart to the news. Like a sudden storm, her tears broke out. She cried, at once, loudly in her sister's arms. 
3-When she was alone in her room, she sank into a large, comfortable armchair and saw the trees outside her window. She sat quietly, but a few weak tears still fell. She looked out of the window at the blue sky. She was not thinking, or seeing. 
4-A sudden feeling of joy began to seize her, she try to beat it back because she did not know whether her joy was wrong. "Free," the little word broke from her lips. When she said the word several times, the dull stare and look of fear went from her eyes. They stayed keen and bright, her heart beat fast, and the blood warmed and relaxed every inch of her body. 
5-From the text we learn that the Mallard's marriage is not a happy one. Louise had loved her husband sometimes, often she had not. Brently Mallard did not give enough freedom to Louise and always had a powerful will bending hers. 
6-After she felt body and soul free, Louise looked into the future and saw many long years to come that would belong to her alone. She began to hope life would be long, it was only yesterday that life seemed so long. 
7-When she walked out of her room, Louise looked strong, well and full of joy. Because she thought joyfully of all those days before her and all kinds of days that would be her own. 
8-When Brently entered, Richard tried to move suddenly between them, to hide Louise from her husband. Because they all knew Louise had a weak heart. 
9-When Louise saw her husband, she had a heart attack. According to the doctor, the cause of her heart failure was joy, she was too exited and overjoyed to see her husband safe and sound. 
10-The cause of her heart failure is disappointment. Louise had just got her freedom, and was ready to begin a new life. But the appearance of her husband made her so disappointed that her heart disease broke out and she died. If the cause was joy, then it refers to the joy of getting freedom. 
11-When news of the train accident came, Richards was at the newspaper office. 
12-When she was alone in her room, Louise felt a sudden feeling of joy because she felt free, and when her husband was gone there would be no one imposing his will on hers, and she looked forward to all those days of freedom before her. 
13-Mrs.Mallard's sister and friend broke the news of her husband’s death to her because she had a weak heart. 

### The Trashman

一位银行家兼大专院校校长为了变换一下生活的节奏，请了两个月的假，去清理垃圾。这两个月的亲身经历，使他对其中的酸甜苦辣体会颇深。他指出了环卫工作的重要，呼吁社会给予清洁工人应有的尊重。

1-According to the text, the trashman collects the garbage at people's backyards and then carries it to the dump by truck. 
2-Dr.Coleman went to collector the garbage to gain experience. At the start, it was pretty hard for him, but things got better for him late on. His partner was Steve, he did driving , and Dr Coleman did the lifting and dumping. 
3-When Dr.Coleman said hello to people on the route, the response he got was either nothing at all, or a look of surprise. They thought the trashmen were dirty and look down upon them. 
4-According to Dr.Coleman, most people treat garbage collectors unfriendly. Once a friend of Steve's wife shouted at her children when they were running out to meet a trash truck. She told her children to stay away from garbage collectors, she thought they were dirty. 
5-I think people don't understand the importance of the work of a trashman. 
6-Steve feels that he is doing a service that people need, like being a police officer or a fire fighter, he isn't ashamed of it., he thinks the trashman is as good as everyone else. 
7-He doesn't tell his in-laws that he drives for a trash company because he perhaps is afraid that his in-laws would feel sorry for him and his wife. He knows clearly that many people are prejudiced against trashman. 
8-Dr.Coleman planned to stay at the job for only two days, but he changed his mind because he found that there would be joy in this, he thought the job was an essential task. He made up his mind to go on saying hello on the route because saying hello doesn't do any harm, and it still feels right. 
9-I agree with Dr Coleman that garbage collectors are as respectable as economists. 
10-A garbage collector's job is hard. I think that though garbage collecting is dirty, it is respectable and honorable, because our society needs it, and our people need it. 
11-Most people were surprised when he greeted them because they thought that trashmen should not greet them as equals. 
12-The reason he made up his mind to go on saying hello on the route was he wanted to change people's views about certain jobs, and show to them that trashmen are as human and respectable as everybody else. 
13-Dr Coleman worked as a trashman on the route because he expected more interaction with people on the route. 
14-Steve was not ashamed of working as a trashman because he believed that like police officer and firefighters, trashman were doing a useful service that people needed. 
15-The writer of "The Trashman" says at the end of the article the society should respect both its economists and trashmen

### The Day I Was Fat

中国有句古话，不能因人废言。对我们身上的缺点或缺陷，亲朋好友往往视而不见，或因为不愿伤害我们，而尽量回避。有时反而是恶意中伤的人道出了我们真实情况，使我们猛醒。一次不愉快的经历，改变了她对生活的态度，成了一生的转折点，使她获益匪浅。

1-The author was never in great shape. As a child, she was always called "plump”, she maintained a respectable weight throughout high school. She began to gain a lot of weight after her adulthood, marriage and settling down, she was at least fifty pounds overweight, but no one in her family ever told her that she was fat, once her mother said that she was too pretty to look so heavy. 
2-When her first baby was born she thought herself a very happy person, because she thought she had had everything she could get. 
3-During"the greatest time in her life”, she wanted to be slim and healthy. 
4-She was at least fifty pounds overweight, she ever try to shed the weight, but she never manage to lose weight, because she just didn't care enough about herself to stop her eating, she tried to lose weight every day, but she couldn't get started. 
5-The boy was driving fast and tailing their car, and nearly ran them off the road, she got into an argument with him. When she got out of the car the boy said to his friend, "Ah, look at her, she’s fat! Go to hell, fat *****!" she was hurt deeply, she couldn't get his words out of her mind because nobody had ever called her fat before, and it hurt terribly. After that, she promised herself that no one would ever call her fat again, from then on, she was committed to shedding the weight and getting into shape. She started a rigorous programm of running and dieting the very next day. Within months, she joined a gym and she succeeded in her efforts: she got into shape. 
6-Besides losing weight, in the past seven years she has reshaped her attitude, her lifestyle and her self-image. Her self-image stopped being about how she looks and began being about how she feels. The greatest change exercise had brought about in her was that she feels energetic, healthy, confident, strong, and pretty. 
7-She has long forgiven the boy for what he said at the pool, because she has come to understand the boy's misery, at the end of her article, she express her best wished for him. 
8-When she said “My body looks good, but my mind feels great”, she meant she had not only improved her appearance--she has got into good physical shape, but also her thinking and feelings--her attitude towards life and the way she feels about herself have changed. 
9-We can learn from the author's experience two things, first, we should be grateful to those who point out our weakness or shortcomings, their words may hurt us, but they will do us a lot of good. Second, we should not hide our weakness or shortcomings, we must face them and work hard to rid ourselves of them. As long as we have a strong will and keep trying, we are sure to improve ourselves. 
10-What Lois endured in the parking lot has helped her regain her self-esteem ,not just her figure.

### Another School Year—What For?

大学的宗旨是什么？上大学的目的又是什么？诚然，大学是培养专门人才的摇篮，但是人们往往忽视了它的另一个重要的作用——用人类历史上一切先进的思 想、灿烂的文化陶冶学生，使他们不仅成为各个行业、领域里的专家，还成为文明社会中教养良好、情操高尚的成员。教育不光是教人要掌握一技之长，而且还要教 人如何做人。本文作者希望所有的大学生把眼光放宽、放远，明确自己大学期间的双重任务。

1-The author has taught in a university for fourteen years, he taught English literature. 
2-The tall boy majored in pharmacy, he showed no interested in the author's literature class, because he didn't understand why he should learn literature, he thought he should not learn literature since he majored in pharmacy. 
3-According to the author, in a technical training school, a student will only receive training, but in a university, a student will receive both training and education. 
4-A person's day of twenty-four hours is generally occupied by his sleeping, working and staying with his family. He needs eight hours ,more or less, for sleeping. In another eight hours a person should work to support his family. In the author's opinion a person should spend his third eight hours staying with his family, according to the author he should let his children expose to the profound idea at home and his family maintain some basic contact with the great continuity of civilized intellect. 
5-The tall boy was not convinced by what the author said 
6-In order to be an civilized human being, one must read books, because there is not time enough in a single lifetime to invent for oneself everything one needs to know. 
7-The author thinks that both technical and spiritual resources are stored in books, when you have read a book, you have added to your human experience. Read Homer and your mind includes a piece of Homer's mind. Through books you can acquire at least fragments of the mind and experience of Virgil, Dante, Shakespeare and so on, so it is necessary to read these great writers. 
8-I agree that a great book is necessarily a gift, it offers us a life we have no time to live ourselves and it takes us into a world we have not the time to travel in literature world. 
9-A university has no real existence and no real purpose except as it succeeds in putting us in touch, both as specialists and as humans, with those human minds our mind needs to include. 
10-The tall boy wasn't convinced by the author because he thought that making money was more important than anything else. 
11-One of the earliest memorable incidents in John Ciardi's teaching career occurred when he was fresh out of graduate school starting his first semester at a university. 
12-According to the author, the business of the college is not only to give students professional training , but to put them in touch with what the best human minds have thought. 
13-According to the author the first course in any science is essentially a history course because everything students learn at the beginning is what people learnt in the past. 
14-According to the writer of "ANOTHER SCHOOL YEAR-WHAT FOR?", the purpose of university education is to train specialists who are also civilized human beings. 

### The English Character

每个民族都受其本身的历史、文化、居住地的地理条件及所从事的经济活动等多种因素的影响，从而形成了某些特性。与人打交道，了解其民族特性，至关重 要。学习英语，当然应对说英语的民族略知一二。本文对英国人的国民性作了较为客观的分析，对照我们的特性，也许我们还能发现我们可以借鉴的他山之石。

1-The best known quality of the British is reserved, the English is the best known for their reserved quality. 
2-A reserved person is one who does not talk very much to strangers, does not show much emotion, and seldom get excited. It is difficult to know a reserved person, because he never tells you anything about himself, you may work with him for years without every knowing where he lived, how many children he has, and what his interests are. When they travel, the English always try to find an empty seat on a bus , or an empty compartment in a train, and they don't like to start a conversation with their fellow travelers. 
3-Reserved is an unfortunate quality in some ways because it tends to give the impression of coldness. Once the berries of reserve is broken down, they can be as friendly as any other people. 
4-The English are known for their modesty because they never say they're good at something even though they think they are. They feel self-praise is impolite. For example, if a person is very good at tennis and someone asks him if he is a good player, he will seldom reply "yes" ,he would probably answer, “I’m not bad." 
5-Humor is highly valued in British. The starting-point of the English sense of humor is self-dispraise, its object is the ability to laugh at oneself--at one's own faults, one's own failure, even one’s own ideals. 
6-In summary, the English character includes reserve, modesty ,a sense of humor and sportsmanship. 
7-The English don't like people who use flowery words and make big promises. They dislike those who show their feelings openly, and get excited easily, because they think such people are not very reliable. 
8-The English love sports. Such sports as boxing, rugby, football, hocky, tennis and cricket were first practiced in Britain. 
9-Sportsmanship means the ability to practice a sport according to its rules while showing generosity to one's opponent and accepting defeat gracefully. The ideal of sportsmanship can be applied to life in general by following the principle of fair play. 
10-I think we should learn from the English the ability to laugh at their own faults and failures and their sense of fair play. 

### The Letter "A" (Ⅰ)

一位建筑工人的妻子，已养育了五个健康的孩子，第十个孩子不幸身残智弱。医生声称这个孩子只能一辈子当个白痴，医学无能为力；亲友劝她不必再为这个孩 子操心费力。可是这位母亲大声疾呼：“我的儿子身残，但智不残!”于是，怀着无限的爱心，她开始了艰苦而漫长的奋斗……

1-Chris's birth was a difficult one, both mother and son almost died 
2-Chris was about four months old when his mother noticed there was something wrong with his son. 
3-Chris' mother found other things about him: his head fell backwards whenever she tried to feed him and couldn't keep steady, his hands were clenched nearly all of the time. His jaws would either lock together tightly, or they would suddenly become limp and fall loose. Also he couldn't sit up without supporting at six months. At twelve months it was same, all these worried her. 
4-His parents decided to seek medical advice without any further delay. Most of the doctor said that the boy was a very interesting but also a helpless case. They told the boy's mother to forget the boy was a human creature and to regard him as just something to be fed and washed and then put away again. But his mother refused to accept what the doctors said, she firmly believed that the boy's mind was not crippled, though his body was. His mother decided to treat him the same as the others no matter how dull ad incapable he might grow up to be. It was a big decision for the boy, because such treatment would help him recover and develop his intellect gradually. 
5-The relatives and friends advised her to take the boy kindly, sympathetically, but not seriously, they advised her thus because they believed that if the mother looked to this boy as other children, she would only break her heart in the end. 
6-When the boy was five years old, the boy was still as helpless as a newly born baby. 
7-All those years, his mother has been trying to pull down the wall that seemed to stand between him and the other children, slowly, patiently penetrating beyond the thick curtain that hung over his mind, separating it from other. 
8-Chris didn't seem to understand anything his mother said to him, this almost broke her heart, but she didn't lose heart. 
9-The relatives suggested putting the boy in a home for idiots, but the mother said "never" to this suggestion, because she believed that her son was not on idiot and it was his body that was crippled , not his mind. 
10-The first warning sign to show that Chris was handicapped was that he couldn't support his head when he was about four months old. 
11-When Christy's parents were convinced that there was something definitely wrong with him, they seek medical advice without any further delay. 
12-His mother had been trying to teach him to communicate.
