### 定语从句

定语从句（Attributive Clauses）在句中做定语，修饰一个名词或代词，被修饰的名词，词组或代词即先行词。定语从句通常出现在先行词之后，由关系词（关系代词或关系副词）引出。

#### 先行词的选择

|  | 限制从句、非限制性从句 | 仅限制性从句  |            |
| :------: | :------------------------: | :---------------: | :--------: |
|          |           代替人           |      代替物       | 代替人或物 |
|   主语   |            who             |       which       |            |
|   主语   |            whom            |       which       |    that    |
|   宾语   |      whose (=of whom)      | whose (=of which) |    that    |

#### 介词 ＋ 关系代词

from where 为“介词＋关系副词“结构，但也可以引导定语从句。
- We stood at the top of the hill, **from where** we can see the town.

像 listen to, look at, depend on, pay attention to, take care of 等固定短语动词，在定语从句中一般**不宜将介词与动词分开**。
- This is the boy **whom** she has **taken care of**.

#### 关系词只能用 that 的情况

先行词为 that，those 时，用 which，而不用 that。
- What's **that** **which** is under the desk?

关系代词前有**介词**时，一般用 which，而不用 that。
