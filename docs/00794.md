## 从句

做题技巧：**找从句、查成分、补意思**

### 定语从句

定语从句（Attributive Clauses）在句中做定语，修饰一个名词或代词，被修饰的名词，词组或代词即先行词。定语从句通常出现在先行词之后，由关系词（关系代词或关系副词）引出。

#### 先行词的选择

|  | 限制从句、非限制性从句 | 仅限制性从句  |            |
| :------: | :------------------------: | :---------------: | :--------: |
|          |           代替人           |      代替物       | 代替人或物 |
|   主语   |            who             |       which       |            |
|   主语   |            whom            |       which       |    that    |
|   宾语   |      whose (=of whom)      | whose (=of which) |    that    |

定语从句中，whom 只能用在从句中充当宾语成分，而 who 都可以：

- The man **whom** you met in the bus is my friend.

- He’s written a book, **whose name** I’ve forgotten.
- Our school has 80 teachers, 50 **of whom** are women.

在非限制性定语从句中，先行词作为一个整体，表示整体中的一部分，即表示“部分与整体”的关系时，不能用 whose 来代替 of which。
- I picked up the apples, some **of which** were badly bruised.

#### 介词 ＋ 关系代词

“介词＋关系代词“结构中的介词可以是 in, on, about, from, for, with, to at, of, without 等，关系代词只可用 whom 或 which，不可用 that。

- The man **with whom** you talked is my neighbour.
- We were struck by the extent **to which** teachers, decisions had served the interests of the school rather than those of the students.
- His best novel was written **in which** he called the “sweet new style” of the language.

from where 为“介词＋关系副词“结构，但也可以引导定语从句。
- We stood at the top of the hill, **from where** we can see the town.

像 listen to, look at, depend on, pay attention to, take care of 等固定短语动词，在定语从句中一般**不宜将介词与动词分开**。
- This is the boy **whom** she has **taken care of**.

#### 关系词只能用 that 的情况

以 who 或 which 引导的特殊疑问句，为避免重复，只能用 that。

主句是 there be 结构，修饰主语的定语从句用 that，而不用 which。

#### 关系词只能用 which，而不用 that 的情况

先行词为 that，those 时，用 which，而不用 that。
- What's **that** **which** is under the desk?

关系代词前有**介词**时，一般用 which，而不用 that。
