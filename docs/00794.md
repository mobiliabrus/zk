2. 以辅音字母加 y 结尾的词，将 y 改成 i 加 -es。如：baby-babies lady-ladies sky-skies city-cities factory-factories
3. 以下 12 个以 -f 或 -fe 结尾的词，去掉 -f 或 -fe 加 -ves。
   1. Wife - wives

   9. loaf - loaves
   10. thief - thieves
   11. sheaf - sheaves

5. 有些名词只用复数形式。如：clothes garments pyjamas trousers pants glasses scissors spectacles
6. 有些名词用变化元音的方法构成复数。如：man-men woman-women foot-feet mouse-mice goose-geese ox-oxen

## 主谓一致

主谓一致的本质是看主语的本质是单数还是复数

### and 表示一个整体时用单数

例如：
- a singer and dancer（一个人）
- Pride and Prejudice（一本书）
- bread and butter（一种早饭）

### 一些关键词

单数：
- 两者中一：either of them
- 两者都不：neither of them
- 每一个：every

复数：
- 两者都：both ... and

### 就近原则

做主语时跟后面的
- 不是而是：not ... but ...
- 两者中一：or; either ... or ...
- 两者都不：neither ... nor ...
- 两者都：not only ... but also ...

### 关于数字

单数：
- three days
- twenty years
- a hundred dollars
- 10 percent of the milk

复数：
- 10 percent of the teachers

### 集合名词作主语

无生命集合名词用单数：
- jewelry
- machinery

集体名词强调整体时用单数；强调个体时用复数
- the family
- the audience

### the + 形容词 = 一类人 用复数

复数：
- the + 姓氏（加s）

the + rest 剩下的（看名词本身是否可数）

## 名词所有格

- 在表示人或动物的名词末尾，一般加 -s 构成所有格
- 如果名词带有复数后缀 -s 是，则只加 ’ 就可构成所有格
- 用在不带 -s 的复数名词后，加 ’s
- 以 -s 结尾的姓氏，即可加 ’s 又可加 ’

- Henry’s 表示的是“亨利家”
- “儿童节”的表示为 Children’s Day

#### 倍数 + as + 形容词 + as +

表示“……是……倍”

如果是可数名词，则用 many；如果是不可数名词，则用 much。

My new coat costs me twice **as much as** the black one I bought last year.

People 是可数名词，所以用 many，不用 much。

They employ 200 people, twice **as as many as** as last year.

#### The + 比较级，the + 比较级

the more ... the more ...

表示“越...越....

**The longer** you work with him, **the better** you will like him.

#### The + 比较级 + of the two

John was considered to be **the brighter of the two boys**.

#### The + 形容词/副词的最高级

This is **the oldest** theatre in New York.

#### 当比较级与“never，ever，any other”一起使用时相当于最高级

I have **never** met a **kinder** people.

She was **happier** than he had **ever** been in his life.

## 冠词

不定冠词"a/an"：

- A 放在以辅音读音开头的词前面
- An 放在以元音读音开头的词前面
- 不定冠词与单数可数名词连用表示某一类人或事物

- 当句中要表达“一些，某”这些意思的时候。疑问句和否定句也要用 some

Many 和 Much

- Much 修饰不可数名词
- 两个词主要用于否定句与疑问句
- 肯定句通常用“a lot of” 代替

Each 和 Every

- 两个词均表示“每个”
- Each 强调个体
- Every 强调全体

Every child has a candy.<br/>
Each child has a candy.

## 一般现在时和现在进行时

一般现在时

- 一般现在时常用的时间状语有“always，often，every day, sometimes, usually, seldom, three times a day”
- 一般现在时表示习惯性动作 Before I go to bed, I drink a glass of milk.
- 表示自古已然的事态 The sun rises in the east

现在进行时

- 表示动作正在进行或发生
- 常用语进行时的标志性的词。Now,these days,always.Forever
- Be always/forever doing sth, 这种结构可以译成“总是....”

## 将来时的表达方式

**用 shall 和 will 表将来时**

**用一般现在时的形式表示将来**

- 表示已经预先计划、安排好的或肯定将要发生的动作。主要用于 come， go, start, leave, arrive, return, begin 等动词，尤指交通工具的行程。The plane leaves at 8 tonight.
- 在时间、条件、方式、让步状语从句中，表示将来的动作。

If I drop the bottle, it will break.<br/>
I will stay here until he comes back.

**用现在进行时表将来时**

- 表示近期确定的安排，但必须指出这种安排的具体时间，以免与现在正 在进行所表示的时间概念混淆。I’m taking an exam in October.
- go, come, arrive, fly, start, leave, travel (表示来、去) Are you comingt hise vening?
- stay, remain(表示处于一定的位置)
- do, have(吃，喝等动词，表示已安排、计划或决定要做的事) What are you doing tonight.
- 用 be+ going(to do) 表示意图，以及必然或很可能发生的事。What are you going to do when you get your degree?

**be + to 不定式**

- 用 be+带 to 的动词不定式，表示约定的。计划中的或按责任、义务要求即将完成的动作，也可表示注定要发生的事。They are to meet each other at four this afternoon.
- be + about to 表示立刻就要发生的事。The film is about to start.

## 现在完成时

- 构成：主语 + have / has + 过去分词 + 其他
- 否定式：主语 + haven’t / hasn’t + 过去分词 + 其他
- 疑问式：Have / Has + 主语 + 过去分词 + 其他?
- 简略答语：
  - Yes, 主语 + have / has.(肯定)
  - No, 主语 + haven’t / hasn’t.(否定)

#### 现在完成时的标志词

现在完成时的含义之一是过去完成的动作对现在仍有影响

- 以 already, just 和 yet 为标志：already, just 和 yet 表示到现在为动作或状态已经、刚刚或还没有发生。
  - He has already got her help
  - He has just seen the film.
  - He hasn’t come back yet.
- 以 ever 和 never 为标志：ever 和 never 表示到现在为止动作或状态曾经或从来没有发生过。
  - This is the best film I have ever seen.

  - He says he has been to the USA three times.
- 以 so far 为标志：so far 往往表示到目前为止动作或状态已经发生。
  - He has got to Beijing so far.
  - She has passed the exam so far.

#### “终止”、“延续”要转换

英语中的动词从词义上可以分为延续性和非延续性两种。在现在完成时态中一定要注意动词这一特性，应将这类非延续性动词转换为延续性动词。

- “Cats” has been on for half an hour.
- How long have you had this dictionary?

#### 时间“点”、“段”须分清

过去开始的动作可以延续到某一点结束，也可能继续延续，这时就要根据时间“点”、“段”选择相应的介词 for 或 since。

- He has been away for two years.
- He has been an English teacher since 1992.

Mary **has done** any of her friends **since** she moved to Berlin.

## 现在完成进行时

现在完成进行时表示某动作从过去某个时间开始，一直延续到现在，并且还有可能持续下去。

- Those cats have been screaming for hours.
- We have been waiting for him for two hours.
- The dollar has been climbing steadily all week.

现在完成进行时所用的时间状语：all day / month; this month / week / year; these days; recently / lately; in the past few + 时间段; since +时间点; for + 时间段，等等。

- He has been working all day.
- They have been building the bridge for two month.
- They have been planting trees this month.
- Car sales have been shrinking recently.
- Vera has been trying to learn Chinese for years.

现在完成进行时与现在完成时的区别

- 现在完成时强调动作的完成，而现在完成进行时强调动作的延续，因此，表示动作的完成，只能用现在完成时，而不能用现在完成进行时。
  - He has changed his idea.
- 在表示动作的延续时，虽然既可用现在完成时，也可用现在完成进行时，但现在完成进行时强调动作的进行。因此在需要明确表示动作还要持续下去时，应用现在完成进行时。
  - We have been studying here for two years.
- 现在完成进行时表示一种不间断的动作，因此在提到做一件事的次数或所做事情的种类时，不能用该时态，而只能用现在完成时。
  - I have knocked the door five times, but I’m afraid nobody is in.
  - The pop singers has sung three songs

## 过去完成时

过去完成时(past perfect tense)：强调的是过去某一动作或状态发生在另一动作前或过去某个时间，或指在过去某个时间段已经发生的事情，它就是过去的过去。

动词 think, want, hope, mean, plan, intend 等用过去完成时来表示过去未曾实现的想法，希望，打算或意图等。

- They had wanted to help but could not get there in time.
- We had hoped to be able to come and see you.

过去完成时还可用在 hardly…when…, no sooner…than…, It was the first (second, etc) time (that)…等固定句型中。

- Hardly had he begun to speak when the audience interrupted him.
- No sooner had he arrived than he went away again.

#### 与 by (the time) +过去时间连用

- By 11:30, we had already had lunch.
- By the end of 1997, I had studied English for ten years.

## 被动语态

#### 一般现在/过去时

一般现在或过去时用 be done, be 有人称、时态和数的变化。

- The foreign guests were given a warm welcome by the children.
- This speech was delivered by comrade Wang. （”was delivered”即一般过去时的被动态）

#### 完成时态

“have done”，被动将“been”加中间。

- The radio has been repaired.

#### 一般将来

“shall(will) do”，被动变“do”为“be done”

#### 现在进行/过去进行

现在进行时：“be doing”
过去进行时：be（过去） + being + done

- The main building of the Northeast Engineering Institute is being repaired by the workers.

#### 情态动词+动词的被动语态

## 从句

做题技巧：**找从句、查成分、补意思**

`Whoever` **wins the election** is going to have tough job getting the economy back on its feet.

## 定语从句

定语从句（Attributive Clauses）在句中做定语，修饰一个名词或代词，被修饰的名词，词组或代词即先行词。定语从句通常出现在先行词之后，由关系词（关系代词或关系副词）引出。

#### 先行词的选择

| 句子成分 | 用于限制从句或非限制性从句 | 只用于限制性从句  |            |
| :------: | :------------------------: | :---------------: | :--------: |
|          |           代替人           |      代替物       | 代替人或物 |
|   主语   |            who             |       which       |            |
|   主语   |            whom            |       which       |    that    |
|   宾语   |      whose (=of whom)      | whose (=of which) |    that    |

#### “介词＋关系代词“是一个普遍使用的结构

“介词＋关系代词“可以引导限制性定语从句，也可以引导非限制性定语从句。“介词＋关系代词“结构中的介词可以是 in, on, about, from, for, with, to at, of, without 等，关系代词只可用 whom 或 which,不可用 that 。

from where 为“介词＋关系副词“结构，但也可以引导定语从句。

- We stood at the top of the hill, from where we can see the town.

像 listen to, look at, depend on, pay attention to, take care
of 等固定短语动词，在定语从句中一般不宜将介词与动词分开。

- This is the boy whom she has taken care of.

#### 关系词只能用 that 的情况

先行词被序数词或形容词最高级所修饰，或本身是序数词、基数词、形容词最高级时，只能用 that，而不用 which。

- He was the first person that passed the exam.

被修饰的先行词为 all, any, much, many, everything, anything, none, the one 等不定代词时，只能用 that，而不用 which。

- Is there anything that you want to buy in the shop?

先行词被 the only, the very, the same, the last, little, few 等词修饰时，只能用 that，而不用 which。

- This is the same bike that I lost.

先行词里同时含有人或物时，只能用 that， 而不用 which。

- I can remember well the persons and some pictures that I saw in the room.

以 who 或 which 引导的特殊疑问句，为避免重复，只能用 that。

- Who is the girl that is crying?

主句是 there be 结构，修饰主语的定语从句用 that，而不用 which。

- There is a book on the desk that belongs to Tom.

关系词只能用 which，而不用 that 的情况

- 先行词为 that， those 时，用 which，而不用 that。
  - What's that which is under the desk?
- 关系代词前有介词时，一般用 which，而不用 that。
  - This is the room in which he lives.
- 引导非限制性定语从句，用 which，而不用 that。
  - Tom came back, which made us happy.

## 非限定性定语从句

非限定性定语从句起补充说明作用，缺少也不会影响全句的理解，在非限定性定语从句的前面往往有逗号隔开，如若将非限定性定语从句放在句子中间，其前后都需要用逗号隔开。

#### who 引导的非限制性定语从句

- Our guide，**who was a French Canadian**，was an excellent cook.
- My gardener，**who is very pessimistic**，says that there will be no apples this year.

副词 where 在非限制性定语从句中作地点状语，指代主句中表示地点的词语。

## 名词从句

在复合句子中起名词作用的句子叫名词性从句（Noun Clauses）。名词性从句又可分别称为主语从句、宾语从句、表语从句和同位语从句。名词性从句由从属连词、连接代词和连接副词引导，为陈述语序。除了引导宾语从句的连词 that 可省略外，其他连词一般不可省略。

#### 主语从句

作句子主语的从句叫主语从句。主语从句通常由下列词引导：

- 从属连词 that，whether, if 等；
- 连接代词 what，who，which，whatever，whoever，whom 等；
- 连接副词 how，when，where，why 等。

What he wants to tell us is not clear

Who will win the match is still unknown.

有时为避免句子头重脚轻，常用形式主语 it 代替主语从句作形式主语放于句首，而把主语从句置于句末。主语从句后的谓语动词一般用单数形式。

It is true that he hasn’t found a job yet.

Is it possible that these next-door neighbors have never spoken to one another.

#### 表语从句

在复合句中，位于系动词之后作表语的从句叫表语从句。引导表语从句的关联词与引导主语从句的关联词大致一样，表语从句位于连系动词后，有时用 as if 引导。

其基本结构为：主语+ 联系动词+ that 从句

- that 引导表语从句，无词义，只起连接作用，不可省。
- 联系动词可为 be, look, seem, sound, appear 等。
- 主语可为名词的：fact, truth, cause, question, explanation, trouble, assumption, belief 等，代词 this, that, these, it 等。

The fact is that we have lost the game.

That’s just what I want.

This is where our problem lies.

#### 宾语从句

用作宾语的从句叫宾语从句。引导宾语从句的关联词与引导主语从句表语从句的关联词大致一样，在句中可以作谓语动词或介词及非谓语动词的宾语。

- whether 引导的名词从句充当介词的宾语时，whether 不能用 if 代替。
  - We are talking about whether we should accept the proposal
- that 引导的名词从句一般不充当介词的宾语，except 除外。
  - I know nothing about him except that he is a Harvard graduate.
- that 引导的名词从句有时也可以用 it 作形式宾语
  - The nurse thought it unbelievable that the Marine wasn’t the old man’s
    son.

#### 同位语

同位语从句说明其前面的名词的具体内容。同位语从句通常由 that 引导，可用于同位语从句的名词有 advice、demand、doubt、fact、hope、idea、information、message、news、order、problem、promise、question、request、suggestion、truth、wish、word 等。

The news that we won the game is exciting.

I have no idea when he will come back home.

同位语从句和定语从句的区别：

- that 作为关系代词，可以引导定语从句，充当句子成分，在从句中作宾语时可以省略；
- that 引导同位语从句时，起连词的作用，没有实际意义，不充当句子成分，一般不能省略。

I had no idea that you were here.（that 引导同位语从句，不能省略）

Have you got the idea（that）this book gives you of life in ancient
Greece？（that 引导定语从句，作宾语，可以省略）

#### The Time Message

The article written for first-year college student, because some of them don’t know `how to plan their study time`.

The author says three thing about time in the first three paragraphs are: time is `tricky`, time is `dangerous` and time is `valuable`.

The author advises us to `make a plan at the beginning of the term`.

A **notebook** can be used to `plan our study plan each day`.

A good plan must be a little flexible because it is `easy` to `make certain changes` when `necessary`.<br/>
It is important that you re-plan your time on a weekly basis so that we can `make certain changes` when `necessary`.

**Saturday** seems to be the best day to stop all study activities because after five days of study, `students need a rest`. Saturday is `a good day for sports`.

**Sunday** can be used to `catch up on back reading` and `other assignments`. 

When you plan your time, try to be `realistic`.

For each classroom hour, we should `at least plan one hour of study`.
