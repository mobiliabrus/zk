They seem (to be) such friendly people, but they never replied to our invitation.

注意：在 seem, appear 等词后，可加其他非 to be 不定式，但这时，他们则不是系动词而是不及物动词。

#### either of +复数名词，谓语动词用单数

**Has** either of your parents visited you?

#### 主语后面有 as well as; together with; along with; rather than 等词组，谓语的单复数由主语来决定

He is **the only** one of those boys who is willing to take on another assignment. ( the only 是对 he 的强调，who 后面的句子修饰 he,所以谓语动词用单数 is)

He or **you have** taken my pen.

Neither the students nor **the teacher knows** anything about it .

His family **is** a happy one. (他家其乐融融)

His family **are** all interested in stamp-collecting. (他们家所有人都喜欢集邮)

### 倒装句

#### 带有 neither, nor, no more 的句子倒装

倒装结构，而且时态（包括助动词）必须和前句一致。so 被用作句首的分句前面必须是肯定句。
- She **never** laughed, **nor did** she ever lose her temper. 
- The organization had broken **no** rules but **neither had** it acted responsibility.

#### 虚拟结构中的条件从句省去 if 时， were, had 和 should 要移至主语之前

#### 带 only 的句子的倒装

only 位于句子开头， 如果修饰介词短语或状语从句，那么句子应倒装。
