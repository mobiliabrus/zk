## 语法知识

### 系动词

系动词，本身有词义，但不能单独用作谓语，后边必须跟表语。
英语除动词 be 之外，还有一些动词也可以做系动词：
- 表示状态或情况的: keep, look, feel, appear, lie, remain, seem, stay, smell, sound，taste 等
- 表示变化的: get, grow, turn, fall, run, become, go 等

#### 系动词后面带名词或名词从句

She seems an efficient secretary.

It seemed to him that he had never worked so hard in his life.

#### 系动词后面带形容词

Henry looked hopeful but skeptical.

She sounded rather surprised on the phone.
#### to be 可以加在 seem, prove, remain, appear 等系动词和其后的名词或形容词之间， 但也可以省略

The task proved (to be) impossible.

They seem (to be) such friendly people, but they never replied to our invitation.

注意：在 seem, appear 等词后，可加其他非 to be 不定式，但这时，他们则不是系动词而是不及物动词。

Courtesy, politeness, good manner? Call it what you will, the supply never seems to equal the demand.

#### 在强调部分时，可用 only/particularly/also 等强调性副词，进一步加强语气

#### 强调句 it 和先行词 it 的区别

如果把 it is (was) that 去掉，剩下的仍能组成完整的句子，就是强调句.

### 情态动词+完成式

#### could+have+过去分词

有时表示过去的时间，说明某事可能已发生，有时也表示与事实相反，表示本来有能力做某事，但却未做。

What happened in the airport could have been true. (可能是真的，可能性比较大)

The director could have produced a better film. (本可能创造出更好的电影)

He could have helped me, but he didn’t. (本来能帮助我，但是却没有)

#### might/may+have+过去分词

表示对已经发生的情况进行揣测，但语气相当不肯定，表示近乎未实现的行为.

You might have done the work better. (你或许可以做更好)

#### must+have+过去分词

是对发生在过去的一种行为的推测，表示过去必定发生过的事情 ，语气相当肯定，表示“肯定， 一定”

It must have rained last night. The ground is wet. (昨晚一定下雨了，地是湿的)

#### should/ought to +have+过去分词

表示该做而未做，表示“本应”

They should have made a good job of it. (你本应该做得很好)

#### should not/oughtn’t to+have+过去分词

表示做了不该做的事，表示“本不应该”

#### can’t(couldn’t)+have+过去分词

表示对过去的动作进行否定性推测。意为“肯定没有，肯定不是”。

#### would+have+过去分词

经常用于虚拟条件句中，表示与过去事实相反的猜测。

表示不必做的事情却做了，可译为“原本不必”“其实不必”

You needn’t have done all these calculations. We have a computer to deal with that sort of thing. (你原本不必做这些计算的，我们有电脑来处理这些)

### 主谓一致

#### many a, more than one +单数名词，谓语仍然用单数.

Many a soldier **has** sacrificed his life for the revolution.

#### either of +复数名词，谓语动词用单数

**Has** either of your parents visited you?

#### and; both and

连接两个单数形式的名词词组，谓语动词用复数。当主语在意义上指同一人，同一物或同一概念时， 谓语用单数.

A boy and a girl want to go. (一个男孩和一个女孩，主语为复数)

A cart and horse is what he needs now.(主语虽有 and 连接，但指马车这一个事物)

#### each and each; every and every 等结构后，谓语用单数.

#### 主语后面有 as well as; together with; along with; rather than 等词组，谓语的单复数由主语来决定

I, together with my mother, was reading at ten yesterday.(主语为前面的 I, yesterday 表示过去，所以用 was)

#### one of+复数名词+关系分句结构

如先行词为复数名词，谓语则为复数.当前面有 the only/very 等限定词修饰，谓语用单数

Joan is one of those people who **go** out of their way to be helpful.(who 后面所跟的句子 修饰 those people,故其谓语动词用 go)

He is **the only** one of those boys who is willing to take on another assignment. ( the only 是对 he 的强调，who 后面的句子修饰 he,所以谓语动词用单数 is)

#### 靠近原则

由 not only...but also, either...or, neither...nor 或 or 连接的并列主语。通常根据就近一致原则， 谓语动词的单复数形式由**最接近它的名词词组的单复数**形式决定。

He or **you have** taken my pen.

Neither the students nor **the teacher knows** anything about it .

#### 由 “a number of, a total of + 复数名词”作主语,谓语动词用复数形式(a number of 意为大量的;a total of 意为总数为)0;由 “the number of, the total of+ 复数名词”, (the number of 意为数量为，the total of 意为总数)谓语动词用单数形式

The number of the students in this university is increasing yearly. (大学生数量在增长， 数量为主语，用单数)

#### 集体名词做主语

##### 当主语为 furniture,equipment,machinery 等词时，谓语动词通常用复数。

The furniture in that shop is all made in China.(这家店所有的家具都是中国制造)

A lot of new machinery has been installed(新安了许多机器)

##### 集体名词如 people,cattle(牛)，police 等往往作复数用

Many cattle have died because of the flood.

##### family,government,class,audience,team,public 等词被视作一个整体时，其后的动词用单数; 被视为构成整体的个体时，其后的动词用复数

His family is a happy one. (他家其乐融融)

His family are all interested in stamp-collecting. (他们家所有人都喜欢集邮)

### 倒装句
### 非谓语动词（to do；done；doing）
### 动名词
### 虚拟语气

- as if 引导的从句要求用虚拟语气。表示现在或将来的情况，动词要用过去式（be动词用were）或would(could等)+动词原形
- 在虚拟条件状语中如果有were, should, had这三个词，通常将if省略，主语提前, 变成 were, should, had +主语的形式。但要注意，在虚拟条件状语从句中，省略连词的倒装形式的句首不能用动词的缩略形式。如我们可说 Were I not to do., 而不能说 Weren’t I to do.
- 与过去事实相反的虚拟语气，从句谓语用had done，主句谓语用情态动词+ have done
