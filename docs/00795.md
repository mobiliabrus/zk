## 语法知识

### 系动词

系动词，本身有词义，但不能单独用作谓语，后边必须跟表语。
英语除动词 be 之外，还有一些动词也可以做系动词：
- 表示状态或情况的: keep, look, feel, appear, lie, remain, seem, stay, smell, sound，taste 等
- 表示变化的: get, grow, turn, fall, run, become, go 等

#### 系动词后面带名词或名词从句

It seemed to him that he had never worked so hard in his life.

#### 系动词后面带形容词

Henry looked hopeful but skeptical.

She sounded rather surprised on the phone.
#### to be 可以加在 seem, prove, remain, appear 等系动词和其后的名词或形容词之间， 但也可以省略

The task proved (to be) impossible.

They seem (to be) such friendly people, but they never replied to our invitation.

注意：在 seem, appear 等词后，可加其他非 to be 不定式，但这时，他们则不是系动词而是不及物动词。

Courtesy, politeness, good manner? Call it what you will, the supply never seems to equal the demand.

He is **the only** one of those boys who is willing to take on another assignment. ( the only 是对 he 的强调，who 后面的句子修饰 he,所以谓语动词用单数 is)

#### 靠近原则

由 not only...but also, either...or, neither...nor 或 or 连接的并列主语。通常根据就近一致原则， 谓语动词的单复数形式由**最接近它的名词词组的单复数**形式决定。

He or **you have** taken my pen.

Neither the students nor **the teacher knows** anything about it .

#### 由 “a number of, a total of + 复数名词”作主语,谓语动词用复数形式(a number of 意为大量的;a total of 意为总数为)0;由 “the number of, the total of+ 复数名词”, (the number of 意为数量为，the total of 意为总数)谓语动词用单数形式

### 倒装句
### 非谓语动词（to do；done；doing）
### 动名词
### 虚拟语气

- as if 引导的从句要求用虚拟语气。表示现在或将来的情况，动词要用过去式（be动词用were）或would(could等)+动词原形
- 在虚拟条件状语中如果有were, should, had这三个词，通常将if省略，主语提前, 变成 were, should, had +主语的形式。但要注意，在虚拟条件状语从句中，省略连词的倒装形式的句首不能用动词的缩略形式。如我们可说 Were I not to do., 而不能说 Weren’t I to do.
- 与过去事实相反的虚拟语气，从句谓语用had done，主句谓语用情态动词+ have done
